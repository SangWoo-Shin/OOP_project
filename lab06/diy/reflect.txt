  Through this workshop, it should have used an input/ output operator. By using the operator,
An output operator that can output in the desired format was created and used in the program,
and an input operator that receives input in the desired format was created and used. In addition,
I used a string library in this task, and I learned about the functionality of getline() in this library.
Moreover, I could learn about the ignore(), clear() and fail() function. Each of these functions ignore
contents in the current buffer, initialize the internal status flag of the cin object, and returned the true value
when an input/output error occurred. Lastly, I was able to learn more about the deep copy through this project.
A shallow copy of an object with a dynamic allocated value caused an error as the values were deleted by
the destructor, on the other hand, by using deep copy method, dynamic allocated values were dynamically 
assigned to the newly created instance and copied, and as a result, the object values were copied to other
objects without errors.
