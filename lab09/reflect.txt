Through the workshop 9, I needed to use inheritance to finish the task. I have to understand about polymorphims.
By understanding about polymorphism, I can override function which has same name in Base class at derived class
and also it require to use inheritance, By using inheritance,  I could use member functions which are located
 in base class's public or protected part. In order to use inheritance more efficiently, it was necessary to understand 
the operating principles of the constructor and the destructor when derived class inherit base class. Moreover, 
it needs to understand about principle of shadowing. In the derived class, a function with the same name as the
 base class can be declared and used, which is similar to overloading, but differs in that all the arguments of the function 
are the same. Therefore, to distinguish each function, I could just use the shadowing function which is in derived class, 
but to use the function in base class, I had to write it with a range specifier like "Base::". 
Additionally, as for the constructor and the destructor in inheritance, when the constructor 
creates an object, it creates an instance of the base class first, then an instance of the derived class, and the destructor
proceeds in reverse order of the previous order.
