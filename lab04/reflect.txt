Through the workshop 4, I used constructor and destructor which are member function in class object. constructor can initialize 
variables which are stored in class as private. At first, when I saw the role of the constructor that initailzes the variable value
in the class, I wondered what was different from the member function 'set' function. But after the workshop, I realized that
the constructor can automatically initializes to the desired value at the start of the program by simply declaring it in the header file.
Of course, the constructor can use overloading function so If I declare the constructor which require no argument and the constructor which
need arguments in header file, I can use both of them in main function depending on how I type the arguments of the constructor.
In order to prevent memory leaks by deleting instances, I also used the destructor in this assignment. Like the constructor, if I declare the destructor
in the header file, then it was automatically executed after the program was over without having to call separately from the main function.
