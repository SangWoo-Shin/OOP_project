Through the workshop 2, I used overloading and referecces in my program. It was quite amazing to me
that even if there are functions with same name in program, if the arguments or types of the functions were different,
I could use overloading to distinguish each function from the main function. Moreover through the overloading,
functions with irreplaceable names, such as read or write, could be used for each module regardless of duplication, making the program cleaner.
Additionally, thanks for reference, by changing the variables in the function, I could change the value of the external variables.
Lastly, through dynamic allocation, I was able to create more efficient program by allocating as much memory as I needed.
However, after using up the memory allocated through dynamic allocation, I had to return the memory at the end, but the process
to find appropriate location in program to declare 'delete' command was more difficult than I thought, so it took a lot of time to
study and analyze it.
