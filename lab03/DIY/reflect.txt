Through the workshop 3, I used class to store variety of variables and member function. The class is similiar with the structure.
However, the difference between structures and classes is that structures store variables in public as default settings.
 On the other hand, in the class, all variables are stored as private as the default setting, and if they are stored as private,
 these variables cannot be used directly in the external function. Therefore, in order to change the value of a variable stored as private in the class,
 the member function that can change this value was declared as public in the class, and when necessary,
 the main function called it to change the values of each variable in the class. At first, I thought this was a strange and cumbersome way,
 but, after finishing the workshop3, I could learn if the program deals with very complex things, this class could control the values of variables in all functions
 by changing the settings of variables in the class because they don't use variables directly in the class.
