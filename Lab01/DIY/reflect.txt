Through this workshop 1, I can learn many different things between C++ language and C language. Firstly, I coud learn about the 'namespace'
which is not in C language. The function of 'namespace' is quite similar with header file. By declaring 'using namespace sdds' on the top of the 
directory.cpp, I can use all the functions and structures which are defined in the namespace sdds. Moreover, by using namespace, I could make
the code simpler. Because if I make a code without a namespace, in order to use functions required in the main function, I have to declare all the
header files in a main.cpp file. But, by using namespace, it was possible to group functions in multiple header files into one namespace and by declaring
it in the main.cpp file, I could use all the functions required in main function. Secondly, in the first semester, I created a program just to get
the desired ouput without checking if the memory was leaking. However, from this workshop, I was able to create a more efficient program
by checking memory leaks using the 'valgrind' command.
