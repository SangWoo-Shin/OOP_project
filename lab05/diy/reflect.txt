Through the workshop 5, I used the function about overloading operator. Through this function, I could simplify
the processing of calculation expression that can be complicated by defining new operators using overloading.
However, when declaring overloading a new operator, symbols other than those stored as default in the compliler
were not avaliable. Operators include conversion operator, unary operator, binary operator and ternary operator.
Firstly, conversion operator allow me to derive the result value I intended when declaring a type in front of a varialbe.
And a unary operator, binary operator, and ternary operator require one, two and three operands respectively.
Finally, ther friend function could also be seen in this workshop, where if the function was declared inside the
class in the header file, this function in cpp file could access all values and member functions in the class, inculding private values,
without declaring it as a function within the class function.
